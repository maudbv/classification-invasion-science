# Classification Scheme of Invasion Science

Scheme illustrating the distribution of major themes, research questions and related hypotheses in invasion science. The network is based on expert assessment and classification of hypotheses as described in Musseau et al. (2024) BioScience. https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biae093

This work is part of the **enKORE** project (2020-2024), a project of the Hi Knowledge initiative (https://hi-knowledge.org).
The Hi Knowledge initiative, led by Jonathan Jeschke and Tina Heger, is an online hub with interactive visualisation tools to make data and knowledge better accessible and comprehensible. 
It is also a community of people—ecologists, philosophers, practitioners—sharing an interest in knowledge synthesis in invasion ecology and beyond.
